Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory **database**

✅ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement **Data Cleaning** to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write **business-driven SQL queries** to derive insights around **pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue** and more

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv) and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

### 1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```
